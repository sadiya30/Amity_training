This project was about developing a model to check mutation in relation to the cf-DNA obtained from breast cancer samples. 

The mutation data for breast cancer is collected.
The cf-DNA data is compared to the mutation data to check whether the mutation is present in the cf-DNA.
Those two files are compared and if mutation is present in a strch of cf-DNA, sequence is retreived.
The sequence is encoded.
Random forest model is trained and evaluated.
It gave an accuracy of 84%.
